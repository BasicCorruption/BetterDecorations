# Better Decorations

This is a simple mod that adds decorations to minecraft. Most of these are non-functional.

**This mod is currently in alpha. This means there will be bugs and unintentional behavior. If you come across any bugs, please report them to the issue tracker on GitHub.**

This mod currently has paper reams and plastic. More will be coming soon!
